# TransformerTempMonitor

The electrification of vehicles and increased need for EV charging stations in homes creates additional load on residential transformers

Current transformer systems are not suited to handle this, and these systems fail regularly

We could change the physical components of transformers, i.e. developing a different type of oil to allow them to operate safely at higher temperatures

This would mean changing the entire infrastructure with new transformers

Instead, we can implement a smarter system that allows electrical companies to monitor transformers by using a digital thermometer, some form of data transmission, and possibly a thermoelectric generator/solar panel to power these
